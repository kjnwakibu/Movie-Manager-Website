<h1>Movie Manager</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I used Django, HTML, and CSS to make a website that allows you manage what movies and shows you want to watch, are currently watching, and have already watched.</p>

<h3>Functionalities</h3>

<h4>Genre info</h4>
<p>There are various amounts of movies and shows listed on the website that are each categorized by their genres under the "Movies" and "Shows" tabs. Under the tabs and each genre, 
  there are only 5 medias that are displayed. But by clicking the "View more" button, you will be able to view all of the medias that are of that type and genre.</p>

<h4>Media Picker Tab</h4>
<p>If you are undecided of what you want to pick or are overwhelmed by the tons of media, you can click the "Media Picker" tab. A random media will be picked for you so it makes it easier for you
to pick something to watch. If you don't like what media it gives you, you can always click the tab again to select something new.</p>

<h4>View Each Media's Info</h4>
<p>By clicking the "View info" button, the information about the movie will be displayed. This includes: the title, the release year, the IMDB rating, a picture, description, and buttons to 
add to specific lists or remove them from the lists.</p>


<h4>Watchlist, Currently Watched, and Already Watched</h4>
<p>When you view a media's info, you can press "Add to Already Watched" to list it a something you already watched. Alternatively, you can press "Add to Currently Watching" to list it as 
something you are going to or are already watching. If you want to save the media for the future, you can press "Add to Watchlist".</p>

<h4>Search Bar</h4>
<p>You can search for a specific piece of media by entering the media's name in the search bar. As long as it's not misspelled, the media's information will be displayed when you hit enter.
Otherwise, a page will display that has the text "Not Found".</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge I went through was styling up the elements with CSS. For some pages, it wasn't too hard, but for others, specifically the genre page, it was a bit difficult. One thing I 
hope to polish up more in the future is the styling for each movie's element.</p>
